## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can disclose vulnerabilities securely through the [Netflix Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com/netflix) site. When reporting a finding, mention the project name or repository in the title and the report will find its way to the correct people.

Please note that at this moment the Metaflow projects do not offer a bounty for any findings.
